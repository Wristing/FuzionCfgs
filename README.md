# FuzionCfgs

Here are my [Fuzion](https://github.com/LWSS/Fuzion) Configs. [Nades](https://github.com/Wristing/FuzionNadeCfgs/)
Don't bother with the names, I just use random words when creating the configs.
Usually they mean the color of the skins loadout. Some are more to closet cheating then others.
Overall almost all of them have the same settings.

# Installation
1. Click `Clone or Download`, `Download ZIP`
2. Open ZIP
3. Extract the folders to `~/.config/Fuzion`

All the configs are made for legit cheating or something close to it. They all have around the same aimbot settings, different skins and visuals
