# FuzionCfgs

Here are my [Fuzion](https://github.com/LWSS/Fuzion) Configs. [Nades](https://github.com/Wristing/FuzionNadeCfgs/)
# Installation
1. Click `Clone or Download`, `Download ZIP`
2. Open ZIP
3. Extract the folders to `~/.config/Fuzion`

All the configs are made for legit cheating or something close to it. They all have around the same aimbot settings, different skins and visuals
